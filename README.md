# 🗂️ File Handling & Exception Handling in Python

## 📘 Description
This simple Python script demonstrates **file reading, writing**, and **basic exception handling** using `try-except`. It performs two main tasks:

1. **Reads** the contents of a file named `my_file.txt`.
2. **Writes** a new line to a separate file named `my_file_w.txt`.

If the file to be read does not exist, the program will gracefully handle the error and display a friendly message instead of crashing.

---

## 🧪 Features
- Reads content from a file.
- Writes a predefined line to a new file.
- Handles the `FileNotFoundError` if the input file is missing.

---

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Make sure Python (3.x) is installed on your machine.
2. Save the code in a Python file, for example: `file_handler.py`.
3. Ensure there is a text file named `my_file.txt` in the same folder, or test the error handling by running without it.
4. Run the script in a terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python file_handler.py
